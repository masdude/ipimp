You need to know the network details of your clients, this is one or more of the following:

**Hostname** - what your PC is named on your network. <br>
<b>IP Address</b> - what address your PC has on your network. (This is only required if your server cannot resolve your client's hostname.) <br>
<b>MAC Address</b> - the unique ID of your PC's network card. (This is only required if you want to use the Wake On Lan feature.) <br>

All of these pieces of information is available through the IPCONFIG command, to run this open a command prompt (Windows Key + R) then type %COMSPEC% <br>

Then type <b>IPCONFIG /ALL</b> <br>

You will get back a load of network information like this:<br>
