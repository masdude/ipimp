This isn't a proper roadmap, just a list of things I plan to do with iPiMP.  These are in no particular order.

 * Get live TV working
 * Add TVSeries to MP client plugin
 * ~~Add [http://code.google.com/p/moving-pictures/ MovingPictures] to MP client plugin~~
 * Add a proper TV guide facility (view multiple channels at once)
 * Get movie and music streaming from MP clients working
 * Expand MP client remote control to allow keyboard strings
 * Migrate to GemX's web services plugin (depending on how development of that goes)
 * Make iPiMP PowerScheduler friendly
 * Add Last.FM to MP client plugin
 * Add Handbrake support
