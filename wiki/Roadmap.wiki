#sidebar TOC

This isn't a proper roadmap, just a list of things I plan to do with iPiMP.  These are in no particular order.

 * Get live TV working (This is the number 1 priority!)
 * Add TVSeries to MP client plugin
 * Add MovingPictures to MP client plugin
 * Get movie and music streaming from MP clients working
 * Expand MP client remote control to allow keyboard strings
