= Introduction =

iPiMP originally started out life as a web based interface to MediaPortal's TV server, viewable in the iPhone's mobile safari web browser.  It has grown beyond that though, the framework used to generate the navigation features now supports more than just mobile safari, in fact it supports any Webkit based browser.  This means that iPiMP can be used from many other platforms including Android, WebOS, S60 and soon the BlackBerry OS so now you can use iPiMP from many many more Smartphones.
