#summary Tips & Tricks

 * *Slider boxes*
 These aren't sliders, they just look like them, so tap - don't slide. :)

 * *Transcoding fails*
 Only report these issues if transcoding fails when using the DEFAULT iPiMP parameters.  There is a *Default* button on the iPiMPTranscodeToMP4 plugin which can be used to reset these parameters.  More often than not invalid FFMPEG parameters are the issue.
