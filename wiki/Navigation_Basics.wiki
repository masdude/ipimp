#sidebar TOC
The iPiMP web application uses the fantastic !WebApp.net iPhone framework which mimics the native look/feel and navigation of the iPhone. 
 
The top bar will always have a back button which (not surprisingly) takes you back to your previous page, the top bar will have a home button on pages which are further than one back click away from the default page. 

iPiMP is made up of lots of lists, list items with a ‘>’ sign at the right side can be clicked to navigate further into the application.

There are also buttons appearing now and again when appropriate.

The best way to find out though is to go look for yourself, so have fun with iPiMP, and please post any issues or suggestions on the iPiMP forum thread.
