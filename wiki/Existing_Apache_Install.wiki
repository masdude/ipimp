 # Download this include-iPiMP.conf file and save it as C:\Program Files\iPiMP\Apache\Conf\include-iPiMP.conf
 # Edit this file as follows:
  * Change ##PORT## to a port of your choosing (Lines 1, 2 & 3)
  * If required, change the paths on lines 4, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 26, 32, 38 & 39
 # Open your C:\Program Files\iPiMP\Aspx\web.conf and add a valid value in the timeout attributes on lines 30 & 45.  These values are explained in the [TipsAndTricks] section.
 # Add the following line to the end of your existing Apache httpd.conf file:
{{{
Include "C:/Program Files (x86)/iPiMP/apache/Conf/include-iPiMP.conf"
}}}
 # Restart your Apache daemon.


These instructions are manual at the moment, this functionality will be added to the Advanced Install option in a future release.
