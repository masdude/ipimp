#sidebar TOC

This section allows users to configure some aspects of iPiMP behaviour, the following settings are available:

 * Select page size - this changes the length of lists displayed in many of the sections in iPiMP, instead of seeing every TV recording for example, you will be presented with a list of a defined size with a '*more*' link at the end which if used will load the next x number of list items.  This reduces the HTTP response sizes and makes for a faster performing application.

 * Recordings submenu - Yes/No - If '*Yes*' is selected then the Recordings section will contain links to sort your Recordings by Date, Genre & Channel.  If no is selected the Recordings section will display your recordings sorted by the configured sort option.

 * Recording sort order - Date/Genre/Channel - this setting is only used if the previous setting is set to '*No*'

 * TV Server menus - Yes/No - Controls whether the TV server menu items (TV Guide, Recorded programs, Scheduled programs & TV Server status) are displayed.

 * MP client menus - Yes/No - Controls whether the MP client menu items are displayed.

 * Clients submenu - Yes/No - If '*Yes*' then individual !MediaPortal clients will be displayed on a separate page, otherwise they will be listed on the home page.

 * My Videos - Yes/No - If '*Yes*' then the My Videos link will be displayed on a !MediaPortal client menu.

 * Moving Pictures - Yes/No - If '*Yes*' then the Moving Pictures link will be displayed on a !MediaPortal client menu.

 * Period for recent movies - This is used if Moving Pictures is selected and controls the number of days which the "Recent Movies" link displays.
