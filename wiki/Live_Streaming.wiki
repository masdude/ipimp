iPiMP uses uses video streaming technology by [http://smoothstreaming.code-shop.com/ CodeShop] to bring live Smooth Streaming of TV channels.

The Smooth Streaming feature can generates a single adaptive bitrate stream which can be played on the iPhone as well as with Silverlight or Flash players. Adaptive bitrate means that the quality of the video/audio can be adjusted depending on the network connection you have, so higher bitrates when you're on wifi and lower if you're on 3G or Edge.

The initial implementation will only have one video bitrate, this will be expanded in future versions.

*Note* - This feature will launch a transcoding process on your PC which will consume a significant amount of CPU.

*Usage*
 * Ensure you stop the stream after you've finished otherwise you will lock a tuner and the transcode process will continue.  You can stop a stream either by pressing on the stop button on the stream launch page or via the Streaming status page in the TV Server status section.
