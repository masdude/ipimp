= iPhone interface to !MediaPortal =

== Introduction ==

iPiMP is a web interface for !MediaPortal specifically designed for the iPhone, it uses !MediaPortal interfaces to communicate with both the TV Server and !MediaPortal clients.

You can use iPiMP to interact with your !MediaPortal TV Server allowing you to view your TV guide, read program details, schedule programs to be recorded, email program details as well as view, manage & watch your existing recordings. Watching live TV though is not possible (yet!). There is a status facility allowing you to view the status of your services, disk capacity and tv card activity, you can also stop a card when timeshifting if you want to kick someone off.

You can also use iPiMP to interact with your !MediaPortal clients, you can use it as a remote control, browse/play your video and music databases on your !MediaPortal clients, send messages to popup on your !MediaPortal clients, view now playing information and startup/shutdown/reboot/standby/hibernate your clients. The client functionality will be extended to provide additional features for other !MediaPortal plugins.
