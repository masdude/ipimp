 === These are current known issues with iPiMP 4.0.0 ===
 *These will be fixed in 4.0.1*

 * *Cannot see !MediaPortal Clients menu item in the Administration menu*
 This issue occurs when you select 'Dedicated TV Server Installation' as the standard install type.  The idea was that some users may not want to use the !MediaPortal client functionality so there should be a way to hide these menu items.  This needs tidying up in the installer/application as it's not quite right ;-)

 The workaround is to set the 'USEMPCLIENT' setting in web.config to true.  

 * *You get a !!FUBAR!! when selecting TV Guide*
 This issue occurs when you click on the TV Guide menu item and is a bug which occurs when you have <2 TV channel groups.

 The workaround is to have at least 2 TV channel groups (they don't have to have any channels in them).
