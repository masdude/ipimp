 * *Cannot see MediaPortal Clients menu item in the Administration menu*
 This issue occurs when you select 'Dedicated TV Server Installation' as the standard install type.  The workaround is to set the USEMPCLIENT setting in web.config to true.  This needs tidying up in the installer/application as it's not quite right ;-)
