 * *Cannot see !MediaPortal Clients menu item in the Administration menu*
 This issue occurs when you select 'Dedicated TV Server Installation' as the standard install type.  The idea was that some users may not want to use the !MediaPortal client functionality so there should be a way to hide these menu items.  This needs tidying up in the installer/application as it's not quite right ;-)

 The workaround is to set the 'USEMPCLIENT' setting in web.config to true.
