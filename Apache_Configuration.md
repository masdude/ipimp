The TCP port is the port used by the apache web server to listen for requests, by default this will be 80.

The IP address is the network address used by the apache web server to listen for requests, by default this will be all IP addresses on your PC.

The combination of IP address and TCP port has to be unique for your web server to work so if you have other web servers installed then the combination of IP address and TCP port may already be in use and you should select either a different IP address or TCP port.

The iPiMP web application can display channel logos of your TV server channels, it will attempt to read the default location of these from your MediaPortal client installation, if this location is incorrect or you are not installing the iPiMP web application on a PC with the MediaPortal client installed then you should select a folder and copy your logos into there.  This is not mandatory, if no logos can be found you’ll just get the Safari default ‘cannot locate image’ logo.

The iPiMP web application has to be logged into, your login is given a specific timeout period and after that period of inactivity your login will expire and you will have to re-login.  By default this timeout is set to 30 mins, however there are a number of options provided if you wish to extend this – up to a period of one year.

Some of the lists in iPiMP can be quite long, you can limit the number of results in the list returned at one time, if there are more entries to be returned you’ll get an added option at the bottom of the list to load the next ‘x’ amount.
